Introduction
============

ROS is a fantastically powerful system. But all that complexity comes at a cost: even for users with significant experience in the technology domains encompassed by ROS, it can be very difficult to know how to get started working with ROS.

It may be that you have purchased a ROS robot, or you're thinking about doing so. Or you're just curious. Perhaps you've chipped away at some of the tutorials on [ROS.org](http://ros.org), but still find yourself baffled and missing key knowledge.

Another possibility is that you've been working with ROS for some time, but can tell that you're missing pieces---perhaps your lab doesn't use version control effectively, or you don't use diagnostics or rqt on your robots, or you recompile during debugging instead of using logging and parameters. It's possible you've never tried to release APT packages of your software, for the benefit of other ROS users.

The aim of this book is to provide a succint series of guides to task-oriented ROS topics. Ultimately, most things in ROS can be done many ways, and you will eventually discover them; the purpose of this book is to present recommend workflows for common tasks---the essentials.

Each chapter stands on its own. Apart from the "Installation" chapter, which will be expected to have been completed, each chapter assumes nothing about your workspace setup.
